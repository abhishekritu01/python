#  Age Group Categorization

# 1. Write a Python program that will accept the age of a person and print the age group.
# 2. The age group is categorized as:
#    - Baby: 0-1
#    - Toddler: 2-3
#    - Kid: 4-12
#    - Teen: 13-19
#    - Adult: 20-59
#    - Senior: 60+
# 3. The program should keep asking for the age until the user enters a valid age.
# 4. The program should keep running until the user enters 'exit'.
# 5. The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully.
# 6. The program should handle exceptions gracefully.
# 7. The program should be able to handle both integer and float inputs.



# userscore = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# print()

age=20

price = 12 if age >=18 else 8
